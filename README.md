# Minigames.py

This project is part of the 2023 5-day Sirindhorn International Institute of Technology, Thammasat University (SIIT), and Osaka Institute of Technology (OIT), international project-based learning (iPBL). 

The project's scope is to utilize the CV2 / OpenCV Python library to create a program that benefits or solves societal problems.

In this project, my group and I came up with a concept of minigames that can be simple and accessible to children, elders, and people of all ages. These minigames are proven to be effective in increasing attention span and emotion control development, which contrasts with modern games which have side effects of reducing attention span and altering emotion control negatively.

The project consists of 3 minigames, including
1. Tic-Tac-Toe (XO)
2. Rock-Paper-Scissors (Janken)
3. Just Dance (Let's move type of game)
